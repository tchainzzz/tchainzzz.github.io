*This post is adapted from "From Biased Selective Labels to Pseudo-Labels: An Expectation-Maximization Framework for Learning from Biased Decisions" (ICML 2024)*.

In the previous post, we discussed the assumption that patients who did not receive a test are negative, and what can go wrong if we make this assumption. So, now what?

# Imagine a magical algorithm...

# Expectation-maximization, explained

# Can we use EM to "repair" estimates for biased labels?
