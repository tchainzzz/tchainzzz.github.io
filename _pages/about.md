Hi, I'm Trenton (he/him)! I am a 3rd year EECS PhD Candidate at the University of Michigan with the [MLD3 Lab](https://wiens-group.engin.umich.edu/) advised by [Jenna Wiens](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wiensj/). My primary research area is **machine learning fairness and causal inference inspired by healthcare use-cases.** My work focuses on the following:
* Algorithms for mitigating the impact of biases on the performance and fairness of AI models 
* Identifying potential sources of inequity in the data used to train AI models  

I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from Stanford in 2021, and my B.A. in American Studies from Stanford in 2020. I've previously worked on video machine learning robustness with [HazyResearch](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/) and open-domain conversational AI for the Alexa Grand Prize Socialbot Challenge with the [Stanford NLP Group](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/chirpycardinal/).
