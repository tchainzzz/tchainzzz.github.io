Hi, I'm Trenton! I am a 4th year EECS PhD Candidate at the University of Michigan AI lab, advised by [Jenna Wiens](https://wiens-group.engin.umich.edu/). During Summer 2024, I was on internship at Microsoft Research Redmond with the [Augmented Reasoning & Learning Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/augmented-learning-and-reasoning/) mentored by Adith Swaminathan and Tobias Schnabel.

I work on **machine learning fairness inspired by healthcare use-cases.** My work focuses on modeling, understanding, and mitigating biases in AI models.

I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from Stanford in 2021, and my B.A. in American Studies from Stanford in 2020. I've previously worked on video machine learning robustness with [HazyResearch](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/) and open-domain conversational AI for the Alexa Grand Prize Socialbot Challenge with the [Stanford NLP Group](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/chirpycardinal/). I was also a contributor to the Google [BIG-bench](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench) language model benchmark.

**Contact.** If you're another researcher in the machine learning, causal inference, or healthcare space--please reach out if you want to chat about research! 

**For current Michigan undergraduate and Masters' students interested in working with me,** please email me to set up a one-off coffee chat if you'd like to discuss some research ideas.

* **[10/24/2024]** Honored to represent the Michigan AI lab in the department-wide research honors competition! Thank you to my peers and my advisor Jenna for their continued support on my research.

* **[10/12/2024]** I will be presenting preliminary results from my internship project at Microsoft Research on designing an evaluation framework for the steerability of large language models at the NeurIPS SafeGenAI workshop! Pre-print coming soon.

* **[09/25/2024]** My paper, "Who's Gaming the System? A Causally-Motivated Approach for Detecting Strategic Adaptation" is accepted to NeurIPS 2024. We present a method for using causal inference as a method for fraud detection, inspired by [upcoding in Medicare](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/08/upshot/medicare-advantage-fraud-allegations.html).
