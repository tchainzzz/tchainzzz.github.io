Hi, I'm Trenton (he/him)! I am a 2nd year EECS PhD student at the University of Michigan with the [MLD3 Lab](https://wiens-group.engin.umich.edu/). My primary research area is in **machine learning fairness in healthcare.** I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from Stanford in 2021, and my B.A. in American Studies from Stanford in 2020.

I've previously worked on video machine learning robustness with [HazyResearch](hazyresearch.stanford.edu/) and open-domain conversational AI for the Alexa Grand Prize Socialbot Challenge with the [Stanford NLP Group](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/chirpycardinal/).

I am interested in machine learning robustness and fairness especially as they pertain to **algorithmic justice and social inequity.**

Current Work
======

I am advised by [Jenna Wiens](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wiensj/). I am working on identifying and mitigating sources of bias in clinical machine learning (ML) models. I hope to contribute to mitigating and preventing harm caused by ML models.

Recent News
======

* **[08/01/2022]** Excited to announce that I will be presenting my work on **disparate censorship and undertesting,** a real-world source of bias with potential to cause harm in clinical machine learning. To find out what it is and what we can do about it, check out [our paper](files/mlhc_2022_disparate_censorship.pdf). 
* **[08/16/2021]** The [Chirpy Cardinal](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/chirpycardinal/) team socialbot was awarded 2nd Prize in the Alexa Prize Socialbot Grand Challenge! Read our technical report [here](files/alexa_prize_report.pdf).
