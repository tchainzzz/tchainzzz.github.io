Hi, I'm Trenton (he/him)! I am an incoming EECS PhD student at the University of Michigan with the [MLD3 Lab](https://wiens-group.engin.umich.edu/). My primary research interests are in **machine learning robustness and fairness.** I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from Stanford in 2021, and my B.A. in American Studies from Stanford in 2020.

I've worked on video machine learning robustness with [HazyResearch](hazyresearch.stanford.edu/) and open-domain conversational AI for the Alexa Grand Prize Socialbot Challenge with the [Stanford NLP Group](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/chirpycardinal/).

I am interested in machine learning robustness and fairness especially as they pertain to **algorithmic justice and social inequity.**

Current Work
======

I am currently advised by [Jenna Wiens](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wiensj/). I am working on identifying and mitigating clinician biases in the context of training clinical risk-stratification models, towards the goal of training clinically relevant machine learning models that perform fairly in the presence of possible clinician bias and healthcare disparities.
