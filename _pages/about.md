Hi, I'm Trenton (he/him)! I am a rising 3rd year EECS PhD Candidate at the University of Michigan with the [MLD3 Lab](https://wiens-group.engin.umich.edu/). My primary research area is **machine learning fairness in healthcare.** To date, my work has focused on analyzing and mitigating the downstream impact of biases in clinical decision-making cross patient subpopulations on the performance and fairness of AI models for clinical decision support.

I am interested in machine learning robustness and fairness especially as they pertain to **algorithmic justice and social inequity.** 

I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from Stanford in 2021, and my B.A. in American Studies from Stanford in 2020. I've previously worked on video machine learning robustness with [HazyResearch](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/) and open-domain conversational AI for the Alexa Grand Prize Socialbot Challenge with the [Stanford NLP Group](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/chirpycardinal/).

Current Work
======

I am advised by [Jenna Wiens](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wiensj/). I am working on identifying and mitigating sources of bias in clinical machine learning (ML) models. I hope to contribute to mitigating and preventing harm caused by ML models.

Recent News
======
* **[05/23/2023]** I recently contributed to a STAT news article about large language models in healthcare: ["What does generative AI mean for healthcare?"](https://www.statnews.com/2023/05/23/chatgpt-generative-ai-research-medicine-health/)
* **[04/09/2023]** I will be serving as the [CSEG](https://cseg-michigan.github.io/) University Relations chair. Excited for this opportunity to serve my grad student community and work with the department! 
* **[10/20/2022]** I sat down with [Rackham Graduate School](https://rackham.umich.edu/discover-rackham/) to talk about my research in machine learning for healthcare, and the direction of machine learning for healthcare in general. Check out my [interview here](https://rackham.umich.edu/discover-rackham/healthcareai/)!
