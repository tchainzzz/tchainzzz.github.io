I am an incoming EECS PhD student at the University of Michigan with the [MLD3 Lab](https://wiens-group.engin.umich.edu/). My primary research interests are in machine learning robustness and fairness. I am finishing my Master's in Computer Science at Stanford University, working on video machine learning robustness with [HazyResearch](hazyresearch.stanford.edu/) and open-domain conversational AI with the [Stanford NLP Group](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/chirpycardinal/). I completed my B.A. in American Studies at Stanford in 2020.

I am interested in machine learning robustness and fairness especially as they pertain to **algorithmic justice and social inequity.** I hope to incorporate my experience with critical/ethnic studies into my work, and learn how we can better frame
